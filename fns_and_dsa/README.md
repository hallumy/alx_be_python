# Functions, Data Structures, and Modules in Python

This project will solidify your understanding of Python’s essential building blocks: functions, data structures, and modules. By the end, you’ll be able to confidently define and use functions (including their parameters, return values, and scopes), work with core data structures (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries), and effectively organize your code with modules and packages. Additionally, you’ll grasp the LEGB rule for variable scope and explore best practices for managing namespaces in Python.

## Arithmetic Operations Function

This project consists of two Python scripts: `arithmetic_operations.py` and `main.py`. The `arithmetic_operations.py` script defines a function called `perform_operation` that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on the provided parameters. The `main.py` script imports and uses this function.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles division by zero by returning a specific message for easier recognition and error handling in the main script.
- Modular and reusable design for flexibility.

## Usage

1. Place `arithmetic_operations.py` and `main.py` in the same directory.
2. Run the `main.py` script to perform operations with the `perform_operation` function.
