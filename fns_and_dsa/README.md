# Functions, Data Structures, and Modules in Python

This project will solidify your understanding of Python’s essential building blocks: functions, data structures, and modules. By the end, you’ll be able to confidently define and use functions (including their parameters, return values, and scopes), work with core data structures (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries), and effectively organize your code with modules and packages. Additionally, you’ll grasp the LEGB rule for variable scope and explore best practices for managing namespaces in Python.

## Arithmetic Operations Function

This project consists of two Python scripts: `arithmetic_operations.py` and `main.py`. The `arithmetic_operations.py` script defines a function called `perform_operation` that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on the provided parameters. The `main.py` script imports and uses this function.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles division by zero by returning a specific message for easier recognition and error handling in the main script.
- Modular and reusable design for flexibility.

## Usage

1. Place `arithmetic_operations.py` and `main.py` in the same directory.
2. Run the `main.py` script to perform operations with the `perform_operation` function.

# Shopping List Manager

This project features a simple Python script, `shopping_list_manager.py`, that allows users to manage a shopping list dynamically. Using basic list operations, it provides a text-based menu to add, remove, and view items in the shopping list. The program ensures smooth user interaction, handling invalid inputs and empty entries gracefully, making it a great way to practice working with lists and user interfaces in Python.

## Features

✅ Starts with an empty shopping list.  
✅ Allows users to:
- Add items to the list.
- Remove items from the list.
- View the current shopping list.
✅ Displays a clear, user-friendly menu.  
✅ Handles invalid choices and empty entries gracefully.

## Usage

1. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python shopping_list_manager.py


# Explore DateTime

This project contains a Python script, `explore_datetime.py`, that showcases the use of Python’s `datetime` module for handling date and time operations.

## Features

✅ Display the current date and time in a clear, readable format.  
✅ Prompt the user to enter a number of days and calculate the future date based on that input.  
✅ Uses the `datetime` and `timedelta` classes for accurate date handling.

## Usage

1. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python explore_datetime.py

# Temperature Conversion Tool

This Python script (`temp_conversion_tool.py`) provides a simple and interactive way to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It demonstrates the use of global variables to store conversion factors and modular functions for conversion.

## Features
✅ Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius  
✅ Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit  
✅ Uses global conversion factors for accurate results  
✅ Prompts the user for input and validates numeric temperature entries  
✅ Handles invalid input gracefully  

## Usage
Run the script and follow the prompts to enter a temperature and specify the unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The converted temperature will be displayed in the appropriate unit.
