# Python Control Flows and Loops

# Introduction

This project explores the fundamental concepts of control flow and loops in Python. It covers the use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) for decision-making, as well as for, while, and nested loops for automating repetitive tasks. It also introduces match case statements (available in Python 3.10 and above) as a cleaner alternative to multiple condition checks. The goal is to build a solid understanding of how to write dynamic, efficient, and readable Python code using these core programming constructs.

# Weather Recommendation Program

A script will ask the user about the current weather conditions and provide clothing recommendations based on the input. This task aims to demonstrate the use of if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in a program.

# A simple Calculator with Match Case

A script that will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The script will then perform the selected operation using a Match Case statement and display the result. 

# Multiplication Table Generator

A script that asks the user to enter a number, then use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

# Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops

A script that prompts the user to enter a positive integer, then use nested loops to print a square pattern of that size made of asterisks (*).
