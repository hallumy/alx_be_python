# Python Control Flows and Loops

# Introduction

This project explores the fundamental concepts of control flow and loops in Python. It covers the use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) for decision-making, as well as for, while, and nested loops for automating repetitive tasks. It also introduces match case statements (available in Python 3.10 and above) as a cleaner alternative to multiple condition checks. The goal is to build a solid understanding of how to write dynamic, efficient, and readable Python code using these core programming constructs.

# Weather Recommendation Program

A script will ask the user about the current weather conditions and provide clothing recommendations based on the input. This task aims to demonstrate the use of if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in a program.
